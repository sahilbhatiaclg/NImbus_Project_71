This project is a C-based dashboard that helps users track and manage home energy usage for individual appliances.
It calculates daily, weekly, and monthly electricity consumption and estimates cost using a given tariff rate.
The system stores each appliance’s details—name, wattage, daily usage hours, and ON/OFF status—and allows users to interactively add, remove, or toggle appliances.



KEY FEATURE INCLUDE:-

Appliance Management: Add, remove, and toggle appliances using a simple menu-driven system.

Energy Calculations: Computes energy usage (kWh) based on wattage × hours / 1000.

Cost Estimation: Displays daily, weekly, and monthly electricity cost.

Dynamic Memory: Uses realloc() to grow or shrink the appliance list dynamically.

File Storage: Saves appliance data in a CSV file and loads it automatically on restart.

Clean Output Report: Displays a structured energy usage report in table form.

This project demonstrates core C programming concepts such as structures, arrays, pointers, functions, control flow, dynamic memory allocation, and file I/O—making it an ideal example of a modular and real-world energy tracking tool.
